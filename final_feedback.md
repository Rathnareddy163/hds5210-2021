Congratulations on completing your Python final project.  I hope that you got some valuable experience and knowledge from our work together this semester.  Please feel free to reach out to me any time in the future.  You can connect with me on LinkedIn and message me there any time.  I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for you.

Here's feedback on your final project, but if you'd like more detail, please reach out to me.

I like the way you approached the project and the conclusions you were looking to draw.  I appreciate the introduction and the documentation throughout.  THere were a few areas where you could have taken it a step further.  For example, you output the correlation table.... but then don't draw any conclusions from that or at least didn't state what those conclusions were.

You could have done a bit more with data visualization.  It would have been good to see some pair plots or more distributions.  I can see, though, that you'd be able to take that the next few steps.  You have the skills now to do it.
