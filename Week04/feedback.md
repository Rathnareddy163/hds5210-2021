Part 1:  4.5/5

Looks like you still had a couple that you didn't get figured out.


Part 2:  5/5

20.3 - Works find.  You could make it a little simpler by taking `families[na[0]].append(na[1])` and putting it after your if/else statement rather than repeating it.  No points off.

20.4 - Nice work.
